# Redis-Server-Exploit
This will give you shell access on the target system if redis server is not configured properly and faced on the internet without any authentication

# Disclaimer
This exploit is purely intended for educational purposes. I do not want anyone to use this exploit to actually hack into computers or do other illegal things. So I cannot be held responsible for any illegal purposes.

# Pre-Requesties
1. A valid Username of the target system

# Things to keep in mind
 1.  Default port of SSH 22/TCP
 2.  Default port of REDIS Server 6379/TCP
 3.  IP address of the target system and User of the target system served to script as arguments
